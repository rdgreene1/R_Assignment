# R Assignment

The script I used to process all the data is located in R_Assignment_Script.R file.

## Data Processing
All the final .csv files are located in the maize_files and teosinte_files_new folders. The teosinte_files folder had an issue during setup and now I can't remove it.

## Data Visualization
Still working on the data visualization section of the assignment. I have a crude script for the first plot but I am still working on the last two plots.
